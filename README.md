# Airline-Analysis
Airline Analysis Data Visualization Project

This project utilizes the Airline Analysis dataset to explore and visualize various aspects of airline performance and operations. The aim is to uncover trends and insights regarding flight delays, cancellations, and overall airline efficiency through comprehensive data visualization techniques.

Overview

The dataset includes extensive information on flights, delays, cancellations, and other operational metrics. This project focuses on:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating data distributions, correlations, and trends.
Data Visualization: Creating various plots to illustrate key findings related to airline performance.
Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing delay times, and categorizing flights by airline and route.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Using summary statistics and correlation analysis to identify key relationships in the data.
Visualization Techniques: Employing scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, and interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
Key Visualizations

Scatter Plot: Visualizing the relationship between flight duration and delay times.
Bar Charts: Comparing the number of cancellations across different airlines.
Line Charts: Showing trends in average delay times over different months.
Interactive Visualizations: Using Plotly to create dynamic charts for in-depth exploration of flight data.
Findings

The visualizations provide insights into patterns of flight delays, highlight the most and least efficient airlines, and reveal seasonal trends in flight operations.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in analyzing complex datasets like airline performance metrics. The insights gained can inform airline operations, help identify areas for improvement, and enhance the passenger experience.
